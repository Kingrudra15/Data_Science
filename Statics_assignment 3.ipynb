    "Q1: Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF): PMF is a function that gives the probability of discrete random variables taking specific values.\n",
    "It is often denoted as P(X = x), where X is the random variable and x is a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF for the possible outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is P(X = 1) = 1/6, P(X = 2) = 1/6,\n",
    "..., P(X = 6) = 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Density Function (PDF): PDF is a function that describes the likelihood of continuous random variables falling within \n",
    "a particular range. It is represented as f(x), and the probability of the variable falling within a range is given by the integral \n",
    "of the PDF over that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The normal distribution has a PDF given by the bell-shaped curve formula. For a normal distribution with mean μ and \n",
    "standard deviation σ, the PDF is f(x) = (1 / (σ√(2π))) * e^(-(x-μ)²/(2σ²))."

    "Q2: Cumulative Density Function (CDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a given point. It is denoted as F(x) for a random variable X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: For the normal distribution, the CDF is often denoted as Φ(x) and calculated using tables or software. For instance, Φ(1) represents the probability that a standard normal random variable is less than or equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: CDF is useful for determining the probability of a random variable falling within a certain range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is used in situations where data tends to cluster around a central value with symmetrically decreasing probability as values move away from the mean. Examples include heights, weights, and errors in measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters, mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). The mean locates the center, and the standard deviation controls the spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Importance of Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life Examples:\n",
    "Heights of a population.\n",
    "IQ scores in a large population.\n",
    "Errors in measurements.\n",
    "Blood pressure in adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Bernoulli Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution: It models a binary outcome, where an experiment results in either success (1) or failure (0), with a fixed probability of success (p) and failure (1-p).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A single coin flip, where success is getting heads (1) and failure is getting tails (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference: Bernoulli Distribution deals with a single trial, while Binomial Distribution deals with the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Probability Calculation for Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: Mean (μ) = 50, Standard Deviation (σ) = 10, x > 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: Z = (x - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation: Z = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, find P(Z > 1). This represents the probability of a random observation being greater than 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Uniform Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Distribution: All outcomes are equally likely over a given range. The probability density function is constant within the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Rolling a fair six-sided die. Each outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) has an equal probability of 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: Z Score\n",
    "\n",
    "Z Score: It measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It is calculated as Z = (X - μ) / σ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: Z scores help standardize and compare data from different distributions, providing a common scale for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem (CLT): It states that, regardless of the shape of the original distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance: It allows us to make statistical inferences about a population mean based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: Assumptions of Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Independence: The sampled observations must be independent.\n",
    "2. Sample Size: The sample size should be sufficiently large for the CLT to apply.\n",
    "3. Population Distribution: The shape of the population distribution doesn't matter if the sample size is large enough."
