    "\n",
    "Integration: Enables the integration of different systems and services.\n",
    "Modularity: Encourages modular design by allowing components to communicate through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "Efficiency: Reduces development time by utilizing pre-built functionalities.\n",
    "Scalability: Facilitates the scalability of applications by allowing components to scale independently.\n",
    "Innovation: Promotes innovation by enabling third-party developers to build on existing platforms.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Using API:\n",
